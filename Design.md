# Traditional Mask Museum

# Approach
This study will focus on two VR museums designed to exhibit Balinese traditional masks. The first museum will present these masks in a non-interactive, static display, where explanations of each mask's cultural and historical significance are provided in plain sight. The second museum will allow users to interact with the masks. This interaction includes features like zooming in for detailed textures, rotating for different views, and accessing multimedia descriptions that might include historical context, usage in cultural ceremonies, or associated myths.

# Introduction

The integration of virtual reality (VR) technology in museums presents a significant opportunity to enhance user engagement, learning outcomes, and overall user experience. This study aims to explore the effects of different levels of interactivity in VR museum exhibits on these variables, specifically focusing on Balinese traditional masks. Two VR museums will be created: one with static displays and plain sight explanations, and another with enhanced interactivity, including features such as holding the masks virtually and multimedia content like sound and video explanations.

The hypothesis (H1) of this study posits that the interactive VR museum will significantly improve user engagement, understanding, retention of information, and usability scores compared to the non-interactive VR museum. Previous research has shown that VR technology can enhance learning effectiveness and user experience by increasing perceived presence, immersion, realism, and satisfaction  . However, these outcomes can vary significantly based on the level of interactivity and the design of the VR interface .

By investigating these differences, this study aims to provide empirical evidence on the impact of VR interactivity in digital museums, contributing to the development of more effective and engaging VR educational tools. This research will utilize quantitative methods to measure engagement, comprehension, and usability, including time spent on tours, questionnaire scores, and System Usability Scale (SUS) scores. The findings will help in understanding how different VR designs can influence user experiences and learning outcomes, thereby supporting the hypothesis that increased interactivity enhances the effectiveness of VR museum exhibits.

# Research Questions

**Main Question:**
- How do different levels of interactivity in VR museum exhibits affect user engagement, learning outcomes, and user experience among university students?

**Sub-Questions:**
1. Does the interactive VR museum enhance user engagement compared to the non-interactive VR museum?
2. What is the impact of interactivity on the understanding and retention of information about Balinese traditional masks?
3. How does the ease of use differ between the interactive and non-interactive VR museum exhibits?

# Hypothesis
## Null Hypothesis (H0)
There is no significant improvement in user engagement, comprehension and retention of information, or usability scores when comparing the interactive VR museum to the non-interactive VR museum.

## Alternative Hypothesis (H1)
The interactive VR museum enhances user engagement, understanding and retention of information, and usability scores significantly more than the non-interactive VR museum.

# Independent Variables
- **Type of Museum Exhibit:** This variable includes the two different virtual museum settings that will be compared. We will differentiate design of interaction of the VR application between the two museums.

# Dependent Variables

## User Engagement

### Time to Complete the Tour
The time participants spend on each museum tour can indicate their level of engagement. Longer times might reflect higher engagement, especially if the time is spent interacting with the exhibits in the interactive VR museum.

### ITQ (Immersive Tendencies Questionnaire)
Baseline immersive tendencies will be measured before the tours to account for individual differences in engagement.

## Comprehension and Retention of Information

### Post-Tour Question
The questionn administered after each tour will assess the participants' understanding and retention of the information presented. Higher scores on the post-tour questionnaire for the interactive museum would support H1.

## Usability Scores:

### SUS (System Usability Scale)
Participants will complete the SUS after each tour to evaluate the usability of the VR museum applications. Higher SUS scores for the interactive museum would support H1.
