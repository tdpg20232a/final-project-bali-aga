## Traditional Mask Museum

### Approach
This study will focus on two VR museums designed to exhibit Balinese traditional masks. The first museum will present these masks in a non-interactive, static display, where explanations of each mask's cultural and historical significance are provided in plain sight. The second museum will allow users to interact with the masks. This interaction includes features like zooming in for detailed textures, rotating for different views, and accessing multimedia descriptions that might include historical context, usage in cultural ceremonies, or associated myths.

### Research Questions

**Main Question:**
- How do different levels of interactivity in VR museum exhibits affect user engagement, learning outcomes, and user experience among university students?

**Sub-Questions:**
1. Does the interactive VR museum enhance user engagement compared to the non-interactive VR museum?
2. What is the impact of interactivity on the understanding and retention of information about Balinese traditional masks?
3. How does the ease of use differ between the interactive and non-interactive VR museum exhibits?

### Hypothesis
- It is hypothesized that the interactive VR museum will result in higher user engagement, better understanding and retention of the information, and higher usability scores compared to the non-interactive VR museum.

### Independent Variables
- **Type of Museum Exhibit:** This variable includes the two different virtual museum settings that will be compared.
- **Interface Design:** Specific design of interaction of the VR application that varies between the two museums.

### Dependent Variables
- **Time to Complete the Tour:** This measures how long it takes participants to complete the virtual museum tour.
- **Understanding of Knowledge:** Assessed via a questionnaire administered after completing each museum tour, this measures the level of knowledge participants retain from the tour.

### Methodology
- Measurement using ITQ - Immersive Tendencies Questionnaire and SUS - System Usability Scale
- Participants will tour two different virtual museum exhibits. After each tour, they will complete the SUS to assess usability and the post-tour questionnaire to measure their understanding of the knowledge presented.
- The ITQ will be administered before the museum tours to assess baseline immersive tendencies.

### Subjects
- Balinese University students in the age of 20-22
- Tech savvy
