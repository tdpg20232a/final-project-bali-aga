# Evaluating the Impact of Interactivity on User Engagement and System Usability in Virtual Reality Museums: A Comparative Study

# Introduction
The integration of virtual reality (VR) technology in museums presents a significant opportunity to enhance user engagement, learning outcomes, and overall user experience. Previous research has shown that VR technology can enhance learning effectiveness and user experience by increasing perceived presence, immersion, realism, and satisfaction​​. However, these outcomes can vary significantly based on the level of interactivity and the design of the VR interface. 

This study aims to explore the effects of different levels of interactivity in VR museum exhibits on these variables, specifically focusing on Balinese traditional masks. Two VR museums will be created: one with static displays and plain sight explanations, and another with enhanced interactivity, including features such as holding the masks virtually and multimedia content like sound explanations.

By investigating these differences, this study aims to provide empirical evidence on the impact of VR interactivity in digital museums, contributing to the development of more effective and engaging VR educational tools. This research will utilize quantitative methods to measure engagement and system usability, including time spent on tours, and System Usability Scale (SUS) scores. The findings will help in understanding how different VR designs can influence user experiences and system usability, thereby supporting the hypothesis that increased interactivity enhances the effectiveness of VR museum exhibits.


# Research Questions

**Main Question:**
- How do different levels of interactivity in VR museum exhibits affect user engagement and system usability?

**Sub-Questions:**
1. Does the interactive VR museum enhance user engagement compared to the non-interactive VR museum?
3. How does the ease of use differ between the interactive and non-interactive VR museum exhibits?

# Hypothesis
## Null Hypothesis (H0)
There is no significant improvement in user engagement, comprehension and retention of information, or usability scores when comparing the interactive VR museum to the non-interactive VR museum.

## Alternative Hypothesis (H1)
The interactive VR museum enhances user engagement, understanding and retention of information, and usability scores significantly more than the non-interactive VR museum.


# Independent Variable
The knowledge and mask material is gathered from House of Mask and Puppets Setia Darma Gianyar. The full list of mask classes can be found in [Mask Knowledge.md](./Mask%20Knowledge.md).

The primary independent variable in this study is the type of VR museum exhibit, which consists of two different settings designed to exhibit Balinese traditional masks.  These settings are defined as follows:

1. **Non-Interactive VR Museum**:
    - This setting presents the masks in a static display format.
    - Explanations of each mask’s cultural and historical significance are provided in plain sight, similar to traditional museum exhibits.
    - Users can navigate through the museum but cannot interact with the masks beyond viewing them and reading the provided descriptions.

2. **Interactive VR Museum**:
    - This setting enhances user interactivity with the exhibits.
    - Users can virtually hold the masks, allowing them to examine them in more detail.
    - Interactive features include zooming in for detailed textures, rotating the masks for different views, and accessing multimedia descriptions.
    - The multimedia content includes audio explanations that provide historical context, usage in cultural ceremonies, and associated myths.

By differentiating the design of the VR application between these two settings, this study aims to assess how varying levels of interactivity influence user engagement, learning outcomes, and overall user experience. The independent variable's manipulation allows for a direct comparison between a traditional, non-interactive presentation and an immersive, interactive experience.

In addition to the primary independent variable, several controlled variables will be maintained to ensure consistency across both museum settings:
- **Content Consistency**: The cultural and historical information provided about each mask will be identical in both settings to isolate the impact of interactivity.
- **Navigation Experience**: The navigation mechanics (e.g., movement through the museum space) will be consistent between the two settings to avoid confounding the results with differences in navigation ease or comfort.
- **Participant Demographics**: The study will target Balinese university students majoring in Information Technology, aged 20-22, to control for potential variations in background knowledge or familiarity with VR technology.

This approach will allow for a focused investigation into how the level of interactivity within a VR museum setting affects user engagement, comprehension, and retention of information, and usability, supporting the study's hypotheses.

# Dependent Variables

## User Engagement

### Time to Complete the Tour
The time participants spend on each museum tour can indicate their level of engagement. Longer times might reflect higher engagement, especially if the time is spent interacting with the exhibits in the interactive VR museum.

## Usability Scores:

### SUS (System Usability Scale)
The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a reliable, low-cost tool for measuring the usability of a wide range of products and services, including hardware, software, mobile devices, websites, and applications. Developed by John Brooke in 1986, SUS has become a standard in the usability field due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

SUS consists of a 10-item questionnaire with five response options for respondents, ranging from "Strongly agree" to "Strongly disagree." The items alternate between positive and negative statements to reduce response bias. The SUS score is calculated by converting the responses to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating better usability.

## Confounding Variables

In any study, confounding variables are factors other than the independent variable that might affect the dependent variable. Identifying and controlling for these variables is crucial to ensure the validity of the study's findings. In this study, potential confounding variables include:

1. **Immersive Tendencies (ITQ Scores)**:
    - Individual differences in immersive tendencies can influence how engaged participants are with the VR museum exhibits, regardless of the interactivity level. By measuring ITQ scores before the tours, we can control for these differences and better isolate the effect of the VR museum type on engagement.

2. **Order of Joining**:
    - The sequence in which participants experience the interactive and non-interactive museums might influence their perceptions and engagement. For example, participants might be more engaged in the first experience due to novelty effects. Counterbalancing the order of joining and controlling for it in the analysis will help mitigate this potential confounding effect.
